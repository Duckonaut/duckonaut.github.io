            <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                stored on your device's internal memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                third party code and libraries used by the app may use “cookies” to collect information and improve
                their
                services.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
            <p>
                The app does not knowingly collect information of children under the age of 13,
                as we ensure all ads served to users under 13 comply with the Google Designed for Families program.
            </p>

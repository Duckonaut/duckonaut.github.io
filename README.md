# Project 
This is just my personal website to serve as a portfolio and a base to add all my projects to.
# Credits 
The look of the website was inspired by the excellent [musicforprogramming.net](https://musicforprogramming.net/), using some pretty color values from LunarVim's [onedarker.nvim](https://github.com/LunarVim/onedarker.nvim).
